# Assignment2
In Part A of the assignment labelled as Lab07-08, implemented a version of the seq2seq NMT model, and then enriched that with attention.
In Part B, having 3 files firstly learned to use pre-trained BERT as a classifier model (Lab09) and then applied it to two dialogue tasks: dialogue act tagging (Lab10), and building a sequence-to-sequence dialogue system (Lab11).
